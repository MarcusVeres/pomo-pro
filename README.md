# Pomo Pro

Pomodoro with ~~hookers and blackjack~~ music and graphics.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Instructions

CSS rebuilds automatically when you make changes.

## Files
* input.css: Tailwind directives
* index.html: Demo page
* tailwind.config.js: Configuration

## IDEAS 
* digital display font - monospace, display dots like on keyboards 
* can mimic the above with physical CSS that is converted depending on signal - "analog" converter 
* settings page / panel to configure times 
* additional panel if you configure with hours 
* modes - for hours, or minutes (or heck, even seconds)
